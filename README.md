OMG, I gotta tell you about Squad 36. 😂 Just finished it, and honestly, I’m like whoa and meh at the same time, you know what I mean? The plot was a rollercoaster but in the most chaotic way possible. One minute you're on a high, then BAM — it's like they just threw a pie at your face, ya know?

> Anyway, the characters—they're kinda loveable, but also like, dude, get it together! Seriously, how can someone be that brave and so dumb at the same time? It’s like they 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed all the courage off the internet but forgot the how to be smart part. 😆

Oh, and the scenes? Sheesh, I mean, talk about over the top. Some parts felt like they were trying too hard, almost like the director was just like, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Sure, but only if you want your brain to do somersaults. 😂 But hey, I guess that's what makes it entertaining, right?

And the plot twists? Wow, just wow. They really just dropped them there, like, SURPRISE! But honestly, half of them were more predictable than my cat begging for food every morning. 😂

Anyway, I think I need a nap after that. All that excitement and confusion—it’s exhausting. And like, what's the deal with leaving the ending on such a cliffhanger? It's like walking into a room, expecting a buffet, and getting served a 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬er.

print(Just throwing in some random code because, why not?)

But hey, if you get a chance, definitely 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it and let's laugh about it together. Or maybe cry. I haven’t decided yet. 😂
